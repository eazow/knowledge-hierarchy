## INTRODUCTION

### What is event streaming?

Event streaming is the digital equivalent of the human body's central nervous system. It is the technological foundation for the 'always-on' world where businesses are increasingly software-defined and automated, and where the user of software is more software.

Technically speaking, event streaming is the practice of capturing data in real-time from event sources like databases, sensors, mobile devices, cloud services, and software applications in the form of streams of events; storing these event streams durably for later retrieval; manipulating, processing, and reacting to the event streams in real-time as well as retrospectively; and routing the event streams to different destination technologies as needed. Event streaming thus ensures a continuous flow and interpretation of data so that the right information is at the right place, at the right time.

## APACHE KAFKA QUICKSTART

### STEP 1: GET KAFKA
```
$ wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/kafka/3.1.0/kafka_2.13-3.1.0.tgz
$ tar -xzf kafka_2.13-3.1.0.tgz
$ cd kafka_2.13-3.1.0
```

### STEP 2: START THE KAFKA ENVIRONMENT
`NOTE: Your local environment must have Java 8+ installed.`

Run the following commands in order to start all services in the correct order:

```
# Start the ZooKeeper service
# Note: Soon, ZooKeeper will no longer be required by Apache Kafka.
$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
```
Open another terminal session and run:
```
# Start the Kafka broker service
$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```
Once all services have successfully launched, you will have a basic Kafka environment running and ready to use.



### STEP 3: CREATE A TOPIC TO STORE YOUR EVENTS
Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that lets you read, write, store, and process events (also called records or messages in the documentation) across many machines.

Example events are payment transactions, geolocation updates from mobile phones, shipping orders, sensor measurements from IoT devices or medical equipment, and much more. These events are organized and stored in topics. Very simplified, a topic is similar to a folder in a filesystem, and the events are the files in that folder.

So before you can write your first events, you must create a topic. Open another terminal session and run:
```
$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

All of Kafka's command line tools have additional options: run the kafka-topics.sh command without any arguments to display usage information. For example, it can also show you details such as the partition count of the new topic:

```
$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
Topic:quickstart-events  PartitionCount:1    ReplicationFactor:1 Configs:
    Topic: quickstart-events Partition: 0    Leader: 0   Replicas: 0 Isr: 0
```

### STEP 4: WRITE SOME EVENTS INTO THE TOPIC
A Kafka client communicates with the Kafka brokers via the network for writing (or reading) events. Once received, the brokers will store the events in a durable and fault-tolerant manner for as long as you needâ€”even forever.

Run the console producer client to write a few events into your topic. By default, each line you enter will result in a separate event being written to the topic.
```
$ bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
This is my first event
This is my second event
```
You can stop the producer client with `Ctrl-C` at any time.


### STEP 5: READ THE EVENTS
Open another terminal session and run the console consumer client to read the events you just created:
```
$ bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic quickstart-events --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
This is my first event
This is my second event
```
You can stop the consumer client with `Ctrl-C` at any time.

Feel free to experiment: for example, switch back to your producer terminal (previous step) to write additional events, and see how the events immediately show up in your consumer terminal.

Because events are durably stored in Kafka, they can be read as many times and by as many consumers as you want. You can easily verify this by opening yet another terminal session and re-running the previous command again.
