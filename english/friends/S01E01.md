## S01E01. The One Where Monica Gets a New Roommate


[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and Monica are there.]

**Monica:** There's nothing to tell! It-it's, just some guy I work with!

Joey: Come on, you are going out with the guy. There's gotta be something wrong with him!

Chandler: All right, Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?

Phoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?

[Monica is rather bemused.]

Phoebe: Just, 'cause I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl. Oh.

Monica: Okay, everybody relax. Relax. This is not even a date. It's not. It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.

Chandler: Sounds like a date to me.

[Time Lapse]

Chandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school. I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.

All: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.

Chandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone...there. 

Joey: Instead of...?

Chandler: That's right!

All: Never had that one. No.

Chandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do. Everybody starts looking at me.

Monica: They weren't looking at you before?

Chandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it. And it turns out it's my mother, which is very very weird, because... she never calls me.

[Time Lapse. It is raining outside. Ross has entered.]

Ross: [depressed] Hi.

Joey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.

Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?

Ross: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck.

Chandler: Cookie?

Monica: [explains to the others] Carol moved her stuff out today.

Joey: Ohh.

Monica: [to Ross] Let me get you some coffee.

Ross: Thanks.

[He goes to sit on the couch. Phoebe starts to pluck at the air in front of him.]

Phoebe: Ooh! Ah!

Ross: No. Oh, no. Don't! Stop cleansing my aura. No. Just leave my aura alone, okay?

Phoebe: Fine. Be **murky**!

Ross: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.

Monica: No you don't.

Ross: No, I don't. To hell with her, she left me!

Joey: You never knew she was a lesbian?

Ross: No! Okay?! Why does everyone keep **fixating** on that? She didn't know. How should I know?

Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian. [They all stare at him.] Did I say that out loud?

Ross: I told Mom and Dad last night. They, they seemed to take it pretty well.

Monica: Oh, really? So that hysterical phone call I got from a woman sobbing at 3 A.M., 'I'll never have grandchildren. I'll never have grandchildren.' was what? A wrong number?

Ross: Sorry.

Joey: Alright, Ross. Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?

[Ross **gestures** his **consent**.]

Joey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single. Have some **hormones**!

Ross: See, but I don't want to be single, okay? I just, I just, I just wanna be married again.

[Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search the room.]

Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! [extends his hand hopefully]

Monica: Rachel?

Rachel: Oh God, Monica, hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there. And then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here. And you are, you are!

Waitress: Can I get you some coffee?

Monica: [pointing at Rachel] Decaf. [to All] Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. [to Rachel] This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and you remember my brother Ross?

Rachel: Sure! Hi.

Ross: Hi. 

[Rachel goes to shake hands with Ross. But Ross' umbrella opens. He sits back down **dejectedly**. There a moment of silence.]

Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet **bridesmaids**?

Rachel: Oh God. Well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in this room where we were keeping all the presents. And I was looking at this gravy boat. This really **gorgeous** Limoges gravy boat. When all of a sudden, I realized - [to the waitress that brought her coffee] Sweet 'n Low? - I realized, I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry. And then I got really freaked out. And that's when it hit me: How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but...[hands the Sweet 'n Low to Ross] Anyway, I just had to get out of there. And I started wondering 'Why am I doing this?' and 'Who am I doing this for?'. [to Monica] So anyway, I just didn't know where to go. And I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.

Monica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

Rachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue.

[Scene: Monica's Apartment. Everyone is there and watching a Spanish soap on TV. They are trying to figure out what is going on.]

Monica: Alright, I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.

Chandler: [imitating the characters] 'Tuna or egg salad? Decide!'

Ross: [in a deep voice] 'I'll have whatever Christine is having.'

Rachel: [on the phone] Daddy, I just...I can't marry him. I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!

[The scene on TV has changed to show two women. One of them is holding her hair.]

Phoebe: 'If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.'

Chandler: Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. 

Joey: I say push her down the stairs.

All: Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!

[She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.]

Rachel: Come on, Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe. You're a shoe. You're a shoe. You're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a, a purse, you know? Or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat. I'm saying I am a ha- It's a **metaphor**, Daddy!

Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble.

Rachel: Look, Daddy, it's my life. Well, well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.

[They all turn to look at Monica.]

Monica: Well, I guess we've established she's staying here with Monica.

Rachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait, wait, I said 'maybe'!

[Time Lapse. Rachel is breathing into a paper bag.]

Monica: Just breathe, breathe. That's it. Just try to think of nice, calm things.

Phoebe: [sings] Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, doorbells and sleigh bells and - something with mittens...La la la...something and noodles with string, these are a few...

Rachel: I'm all better now.

Phoebe: [**grins**, to Chandler and Joey] I helped!

Monica: Okay. Look, this is probably for the best, you know. Independence. Taking control of your life. The 'whole' hat thing.

Joey: And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live right across the hall. And he's away a lot.

Monica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!

Joey: What? Like there's a rule or something!

[The door **buzzer** sounds.])

Chandler: I got it. Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound.

Paul: [over the intercom] It's, uh, it's Paul.

Monica: Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in.

Joey: Who's Paul?

Ross: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?

Monica: Maybe. 

Joey: Wait a minute. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?

Ross: He finally asked you out?

Monica: Yes!

Chandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.

Monica: Rach, wait, I can cancel.

Rachel: Oh God. Please, no. Go. I will be fine.

Monica: Ross, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?

Ross: [lowers his voice] That'd be good...

Monica: [**miserable**] Really?

Ross: [normal voice] No. Go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!

Phoebe: [to Chandler] What does that mean? Does he sell it? Drink it? Or he just complains a lot?

[Chandler doesn't know neither.]

[There's a knock on the door.]

Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is...[They are all lined up next to the door.] everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.

All: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy!

Chandler: I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?

Monica: Okay, I'll just, I'll be right back. I just gotta go uh, go uh...

Ross: A wandering?

Monica: Change! Okay, sit down. [shows Paul in] Two seconds.

Paul: Okay.

Phoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.

[Monica goes to change.]

Joey: Hey, Paul!

Paul: Yeah?

Joey: Here's a little tip. She really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and ove again until it starts to get a little red.

Monica: [yells from the bedroom] Shut up, Joey!

Ross: So Rachel, what are you, uh, what are you up to tonight?

Rachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon. So, nothing.

Ross: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your(thinks) big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.

Joey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
flavor n.口味/lemme<口>let me/nut n.坚果/whipped cream n.生奶油

Rocky road ice cream is a chocolate flavor, recently ranked tenth in popularity in the United States. Though there are variations on the flavor, it is traditionally composed of chocolate ice cream, nuts and marshmallows(n.棉花糖). The flavor is claimed to have been created in 1929 by William Dreyer when he cut up walnuts(n.胡桃) and marshmallows with his wife's sewing scissors and added them to his chocolate ice cream during the Great Depression. The company claims it was then so named "to give folks something to smile about in the midst of the Great Depression." Another host says the flavors were created by a Milton Ainbinder, while owning an ice cream toppings factory. Alternately, Fenton's Creamery in Oakland, California, claims that William Dreyer based his recipe on a Rocky Road ice cream invented by his friend, Fenton's George Farren, who blended his Rocky Road candy bar into ice cream; however Dreyer substituted almonds(n.杏仁) for walnuts.

Cookie dough refers to a blend of cookie ingredients which has been mixed into a solid yet malleable(adj.有延展性的) form but has not yet been hardened by heat. The dough is often then separated and the portions baked to individual cookies, or eaten as is.Cookie dough can be or bought pre-made in packs. Desserts containing cookie dough, such as ice cream, are also frequently marketed. It is also commonly sold as a fundraiser(n.资金筹集活动)

Priest on TV: Do you take Joanie...

Rachel: Oh...see... but Joanie loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference! ：What Rachel said is funny is because Rachel here was sarcastic about her running away from altar.She was deeply moved by the true love between Joanne and Chachi which leads to a successful holy matrimony,while she and Barry had almost everything but love and that results in her disappointment in their matrimony.So she felt right to have escaped from a doomed marrige with a person she would never love. 

[Scene: Ross's Apartment, they're all sitting around and talking.]

Ross: (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?

Here, I assume, Ross likens it to(与……相比) his tragic love affair in a sappy(adj.易动感情的) manner, you know, his wife is a lesbian

The first half was originally a serial(n.连载小说) between 1881 and 1883, and then later completed as a book for children in February 1883. It is about the mischievous(adj.淘气的) adventures of Pinocchio, an animated marionette(n.牵线木偶), and his poor father, a woodcarver named Geppetto. It is considered a classic of children's literature and has spawned many derivative works of art, such as Disney's 1940 animated movie of the same name, and commonplace ideas, such as a liar's long nose.

Geppetto is the old carpenter who creates Pinocchio, when the wooden structure is done, the first words said by Pinocchio are “I’m a real live boy!”

Chandler: 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'

Joey: I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door and opens it to leave.)
