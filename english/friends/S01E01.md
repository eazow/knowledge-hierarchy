## S01E01. The One Where Monica Gets a New Roommate


[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and Monica are there.]

**Monica:** There's nothing to tell! It-it's, just some guy I work with!

Joey: Come on, you are going out with the guy. There's gotta be something wrong with him!

Chandler: All right, Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?

Phoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?

[Monica is rather bemused.]

Phoebe: Just, 'cause I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl. Oh.

Monica: Okay, everybody relax. Relax. This is not even a date. It's not. It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.

Chandler: Sounds like a date to me.

[Time Lapse]

Chandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school. I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.

All: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.

Chandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone...there. 

Joey: Instead of...?

Chandler: That's right!

All: Never had that one. No.

Chandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do. Everybody starts looking at me.

Monica: They weren't looking at you before?

Chandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it. And it turns out it's my mother, which is very very weird, because... she never calls me.

[Time Lapse. It is raining outside. Ross has entered.]

Ross: [depressed] Hi.

Joey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.

Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?

Ross: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck.

Chandler: Cookie?

Monica: [explains to the others] Carol moved her stuff out today.

Joey: Ohh.

Monica: [to Ross] Let me get you some coffee.

Ross: Thanks.

[He goes to sit on the couch. Phoebe starts to pluck at the air in front of him.]

Phoebe: Ooh! Ah!

Ross: No. Oh, no. Don't! Stop cleansing my aura. No. Just leave my aura alone, okay?

Phoebe: Fine. Be **murky**!

Ross: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.

Monica: No you don't.

Ross: No, I don't. To hell with her, she left me!

Joey: You never knew she was a lesbian?

Ross: No! Okay?! Why does everyone keep **fixating** on that? She didn't know. How should I know?

Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian. [They all stare at him.] Did I say that out loud?

Ross: I told Mom and Dad last night. They, they seemed to take it pretty well.

Monica: Oh, really? So that hysterical phone call I got from a woman sobbing at 3 A.M., 'I'll never have grandchildren. I'll never have grandchildren.' was what? A wrong number?

Ross: Sorry.

Joey: Alright, Ross. Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?

[Ross **gestures** his **consent**.]

Joey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single. Have some **hormones**!

Ross: See, but I don't want to be single, okay? I just, I just, I just wanna be married again.

[Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search the room.]

Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! [extends his hand hopefully]

Monica: Rachel?

Rachel: Oh God, Monica, hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there. And then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here. And you are, you are!

Waitress: Can I get you some coffee?

Monica: [pointing at Rachel] Decaf. [to All] Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. [to Rachel] This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and you remember my brother Ross?

Rachel: Sure! Hi.

Ross: Hi. 

[Rachel goes to shake hands with Ross. But Ross' umbrella opens. He sits back down **dejectedly**. There a moment of silence.]

Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet **bridesmaids**?

Rachel: Oh God. Well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in this room where we were keeping all the presents. And I was looking at this gravy boat. This really **gorgeous** Limoges gravy boat. When all of a sudden, I realized - [to the waitress that brought her coffee] Sweet 'n Low? - I realized, I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry. And then I got really freaked out. And that's when it hit me: How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but...[hands the Sweet 'n Low to Ross] Anyway, I just had to get out of there. And I started wondering 'Why am I doing this?' and 'Who am I doing this for?'. [to Monica] So anyway, I just didn't know where to go. And I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.

Monica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

Rachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue.

[Scene: Monica's Apartment. Everyone is there and watching a Spanish soap on TV. They are trying to figure out what is going on.]

Monica: Alright, I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.

Chandler: [imitating the characters] 'Tuna or egg salad? Decide!'

Ross: [in a deep voice] 'I'll have whatever Christine is having.'

Rachel: [on the phone] Daddy, I just...I can't marry him. I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!

[The scene on TV has changed to show two women. One of them is holding her hair.]

Phoebe: 'If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.'

Chandler: Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. 

Joey: I say push her down the stairs.

All: Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!

[She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.]

Rachel: Come on, Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe. You're a shoe. You're a shoe. You're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a, a purse, you know? Or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat. I'm saying I am a ha- It's a **metaphor**, Daddy!

Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble.

Rachel: Look, Daddy, it's my life. Well, well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.

[They all turn to look at Monica.]

Monica: Well, I guess we've established she's staying here with Monica.

Rachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait, wait, I said 'maybe'!

[Time Lapse. Rachel is breathing into a paper bag.]

Monica: Just breathe, breathe. That's it. Just try to think of nice, calm things.

Phoebe: [sings] Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, doorbells and sleigh bells and - something with mittens...La la la...something and noodles with string, these are a few...

Rachel: I'm all better now.

Phoebe: [**grins**, to Chandler and Joey] I helped!

Monica: Okay. Look, this is probably for the best, you know. Independence. Taking control of your life. The 'whole' hat thing.

Joey: And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live right across the hall. And he's away a lot.

Monica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!

Joey: What? Like there's a rule or something!

[The door **buzzer** sounds.])

Chandler: I got it. Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound.

Paul: [over the intercom] It's, uh, it's Paul.

Monica: Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in.

Joey: Who's Paul?

Ross: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?

Monica: Maybe. 

Joey: Wait a minute. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?

Ross: He finally asked you out?

Monica: Yes!

Chandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.

Monica: Rach, wait, I can cancel.

Rachel: Oh God. Please, no. Go. I will be fine.

Monica: Ross, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?

Ross: [lowers his voice] That'd be good...

Monica: [**miserable**] Really?

Ross: [normal voice] No. Go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!

Phoebe: [to Chandler] What does that mean? Does he sell it? Drink it? Or he just complains a lot?

[Chandler doesn't know neither.]

[There's a knock on the door.]

Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is...[They are all lined up next to the door.] everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.

All: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy!

Chandler: I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?

Monica: Okay, I'll just, I'll be right back. I just gotta go uh, go uh...

Ross: A wandering?

Monica: Change! Okay, sit down. [shows Paul in] Two seconds.

Paul: Okay.

Phoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.

[Monica goes to change.]

Joey: Hey, Paul!

Paul: Yeah?

Joey: Here's a little tip. She really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and ove again until it starts to get a little red.

Monica: [yells from the bedroom] Shut up, Joey!

Ross: So Rachel, what are you, uh, what are you up to tonight?

Rachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon. So, nothing.

Ross: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year, talk about your big lizards. Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my, my new furniture.

Chandler: Yes. We're very excited about it.

Rachel: Well, actually, thanks. But I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been a long day.

Ross: Oh, sure. Okay. Sure.

Joey: Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help?

Phoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.

Commercial Break


[Scene: The Subway. Phoebe is singing for change.]

Phoebe: [sings] Love is sweet as summer showers.
Love is a **wondrous** work of art.
But your love, oh, your love, your love...
is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.
La-la-la-la-la-[A passerby drops a coin into her guitar case.] Thank you. [sings] La-la-la-la...ohhh...


[Scene: Ross's Apartment. The guys are there assembling furniture.]

Ross: [squatting and reading the instructions] I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing. I see no worm guys whatsoever. And I
cannot feel my legs.

[Joey and Chandler are finishing assembling the bookcase.]

Joey: I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.

Chandler: It's a beautiful thing.

Joey: [picks up a leftover part] What's this?

Chandler: I would have to say that is a L-shaped bracket.

Joey: Which goes where?

Chandler: I have no idea.

[Joey checks that Ross is not looking and dumps it in a plant pot.]

Joey: Done with the bookcase!

Chandler: All finished!

Ross: [clutching a beer can and sniffing] This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can. I should have known.

Joey: Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff, we're outta here.

Chandler: Yes. Please don't spoil all this fun.

Joey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the **stereo**, the good TV. What did you get?

Ross: You guys.

Chandler: Oh God.

Joey: You got screwed.

Chandler: Oh my God!


[Scene: A Restaurant. Monica and Paul are having dinner.]

Monica: Oh my God!

Paul: I know. I know. I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?

Monica: My brother's going through that right now. He's such a mess. How did you get through it?

Paul: Well, you might try 'accidentally' breaking something valuable of hers, say her-

Monica: Leg?

Paul: [laughs] That's one way of doing it. Me, I, I went for the watch.

Monica: You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was I-I shredded my old boyfriend favourite bath towel.

Paul: Ooh, steer clear of you.

Monica: That's right.


[Scene: Monica's Apartment. Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]

Rachel: Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't. It isn't. It's about me, and I ju- [She stops talking and dials the phone.] Hi, machine cut me off again. Anyway, look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel. But it isn't me. It's not me.


[Scene: Ross's Apartment. Ross is drinking beer while Joey and Chandler are working on some more furniture.]

Ross: I'm divorced. I'm only 26, and I'm divorced!

Joey: Shut up!

Chandler: You must stop! [He hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.]

Ross: That only took me an hour.

Chandler: Ross, you gotta understand, between us, we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however, have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing, at the end of which she ripped your heart out. And that's why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!

Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, you know? I mean, what if you get one woman and that's it? Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman... for her.

Joey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road and Cookie Dough, and-Bing!-Cherry Vanilla. You should get them with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!

Ross: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.

Chandler: Stay out of my freezer!


[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]

Paul: Ever since she walked out on me, I...

Monica: What? What? What? You wanna spell it out with noodles?

Paul: No. It's, it's more of a fifth date kinda **revelation**.

Monica: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?

Paul: Isn't there?

Monica: Yeah, yeah. I think there is. What were you gonna say?

Paul: Well, ever-ev-ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform [Monica takes a sip of her drink.] ...sexually.

Monica: [**spits out** her drink in shock] Oh God. Oh God. I am so...I am so sorry.

Paul: It's okay.

Monica: I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um, how long?

Paul: Two years.

Monica: Wow! I-I-I'm glad you smashed her watch.

Paul: So you still think you, um, might want that fifth date?

Monica: Yeah. Yeah, I do.


[Scene: Monica's Apartment. Rachel is watching Joanie Loves Chachi. She is holding her wedding dress in her chest.]

Priest: [on TV] We are gathered here to join together Joanie Louise Cunningham and Charles Chachi-Chachi-Chachi Arcola in the bonds of holy matrimony. Marriage is the most sacred...

Joanie： I, Joanie take you, Chachi, as my lawful husband.

Priest: Do you take Joanie...

Rachel: Oh, see, but Joanie loved Chachi. That's the difference.


[Scene: Ross' Apartment. They're all sitting around.]

Ross: [scornful] 'Grab a spoon'. Do you know how long it's been since I grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?

Joey: Great story. But I gotta go. I got a date with Andrea. Angela. Andrea. Oh, man. [looks at Chandler for help]

Chandler: Andrea's the screamer. Angela has cats.

Joey: Right. Thanks. It's Julie. I'm outta here. [exits]

Ross: You know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to-to ask a woman out, who am I gonna ask? [He gazes out of the window.]

[Cut to Rachel staring out of her window]

Commercial Break


[Scene: Monica's Apartment. Rachel is making coffee for Joey and Chandler.]

Rachel: Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.

Chandler: That is amazing.

Joey: Congratulations.

Rachel: You know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.

Chandler: No, I think it's, 'if I can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.'

Joey: Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... [Joey and Chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.] Although actually I'm really not that hungry...

Monica: [comes out of her bedroom, to herself] Oh good, Lenny and Squiggy are here.

All: Morning. Good morning.

Paul: [enters] Morning.

Joey: Morning, Paul.

Rachel: Hello, Paul.

Chandler: Hi, Paul, is it?

Monica: I had a really great time last night.

[Monica and Paul walk to the door. The others move the table closer, so that they can hear what they are talking about.]

Paul: Thank you. Thank you so much!

Monica: We'll talk later.

Paul: Yeah. [They kiss.] Thank you. [exits]

Joey: That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?

Monica: Shut up, and put my table back.

Chandler: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference...

Rachel: So, like, you guys all have jobs?

Monica: Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.

Joey: Yeah, I'm an actor.

Rachel: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?

Joey: Oh, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

Monica: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the reruns' production of Pinocchio.
Monica: Oh, wait, wait. Unless you happened to catch the Wee One's production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.

Joey: It was a job, alright?

Chandler: 'Look, Geppetto, I'm a real live boy.'

Joey: I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door and opens it to leave.)
Joey: I will not take this abuse. [opens the door to leave]

Chandler: You're right. I'm sorry. [bursts into song and dance out of the door] 'Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...'

Joey: You should both know that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler? [starts after Chandler]

Monica: So how are you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.

Rachel: I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.

Monica: I know. He's just so...You remember you and Tony DeMarco?

Rachel: Oh, yeah.

Monica: Well, it's like that. With feelings.

Rachel: Oh wow! Are you in trouble.

Monica: Big time!

Rachel: Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.

Monica: I think we are getting a little ahead of ourselves here. Okay. Okay. I'm just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.

Rachel: Oh, wish me luck!

Monica: What for? 

Rachel: I'm gonna go get one of those...job things.

[Monica exits.]


[Scene: Iridium. Monica is working as Franny enters.]

Franny: Hey, Monica.

Monica: Hey, Franny. Welcome back. How was Florida?

Franny: You had sex, didn't you?

Monica: How do you do that?

Franny: Oh, I hate you. I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So, who?

Monica: You know Paul? 

Franny: Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.

Monica: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?

Franny: Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. You know, before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years. 


[Scene: Central Perk. Everyone but Rachel is there.]

Joey: [sitting on the arm of the couch] Of course it was a line!

Monica: Why? Why? Why would anybody do something like that?

Ross: I assume we're looking for an answer more **sophisticated** than 'to get you into bed'.

Monica: I hate men. I hate men!

Phoebe: Oh no, don't hate. You don't want to put that out into the universe.

Monica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?

Phoebe: All right, come here, give me your feet. [She starts massaging them.]

Monica: I just thought he was nice, you know.

Joey: [bursts out laughing] I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!

Monica: Oh. [pushes him off of the arm of the couch]

[Rachel enters with a shopping bag.]
Rachel: Guess what? 

Ross: You got a job? 

Rachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.

Chandler: And yet you're surprisingly **upbeat**.

Rachel: Well, you would be too if you found John & David boots on sale, 50% off!

Chandler: Oh, how well you know me.

Rachel: They are my new 'I don't need a job. I don't need my parents. I've got great boots' boots!

Monica: How did you pay for them?

Rachel: Uh, credit card. 

Monica: And who pays for that?

Rachel: Um...my father.


[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Everyone is sitting around the kitchen table. Rachel's credit cards are spread out on the table along with a pair of scissors.]

Rachel: Oh God. Come on, you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.

Monica: C'mon, Rachel. You can't live off your parents your whole life.

Rachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married.

Phoebe: C'mon, give her a break. It's hard being on your own for the first time.

Rachel: Thank you. 

Phoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city, I was 14. My mom had just killed herself and my stepdad was back in prison. And I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside Port Authority. And then he killed himself. And then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.

Ross: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'.

Monica: All right, you ready?

Rachel: No. No. No. I'm not ready. How can I be ready? 'Hey, Rach. You ready to jump out the airplane without parachute?' Come on, I can't do this!

Monica: You can. I know you can!

Rachel: I don't think so.

Ross: Come on, you made coffee. You can do anything!

[Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.]

All: Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut...

[She cuts one of the cards and they cheer.]

Rachel: You know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture.

Monica: Rachel, that was a library card.

All: Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut...

Chandler: You know, if you listen very closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.

[Rachel finishes cutting them up and they all cheer.]

Monica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it.

[Time Lapse. Monica, Rachel and Ross are sitting in the living room. The TV finishes its broadcast by playing the national anthem.]

Monica: That's it. [to Ross] Are you gonna crash on the couch?

Ross: No. I gotta go home sometime.

Monica: Are you gonna be okay?

Ross: Yeah. 

Rachel: Hey, Mon, look what I just found on the floor. [Monica smiles.] What?

Monica: That's Paul's watch. You-you just put it back where you found it. Oh boy.[stands up] Alright. Goodnight, everybody.

Ross and Rachel: Good night.

[Monica stomps on Paul's watch and goes into her room.]

Ross: Mmm. [They both reach for the last cookie.] Oh, no.

Rachel: I'm sorry.

Ross: No, no-no. Go, go-go.

Rachel: No. Have it, really. I don't want it.

Ross: Split it?

Rachel: Okay. 

Ross: Okay. [splits it and hands Rachel the other half]

Rachel: Thanks.

Ross: You know, you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.

Rachel: I knew.

Ross: You did. Oh. I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.

Rachel: I did. 

Ross: Oh. Listen, do you think...? And try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here. But do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime? Maybe?

Rachel: Yeah. Maybe.

Ross: Okay. Okay, maybe I will.

Rachel: Good night.

Ross: Good night.

[Rachel goes into her room. Monica enters the living room as Ross is leaving.]

Monica: See you.

Ross: Umm hmm.

Monica: Wait, wait. Hey, what's with you?

Ross: I just grabbed a spoon.

[Ross exits. Monica has no idea what that means.]

Closing Credits


[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.] 

Joey: I can't believe what I'm hearing here.

Phoebe: [sings] I can't believe what I'm hearing here.

Monica: What? I-I said you had a-

Phoebe: [sings] What I said you had-

Monica: [to Phoebe] Would you stop?

Phoebe: Oh, was I doing it again?

All: Yes!

Rachel: [walks up with a pot of coffee] Would anybody like more coffee?

Chandler: Did you make it? Or you're just serving it?

Rachel: I'm just serving it.

All: Yeah. I'll have a cup of coffee.

Chandler: Kids, new dream. I'm in Las Vegas.

[Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.]

Chandler: Okay. So, I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minnelli...
