Vera's curious talent was brought to the notice of a scientific research institute in the town of Ulyanovsk, near where she lives, and in April she was given a series of tests by a special commission of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federal Republic. 

DuringÂ these tests she was able to read a newspaper through an opaque screen and, stranger still, by moving her elbow over a child's game of Lotto she was able to describe the figures and colours printed on it; and, in another instance, wearing stockings and slippers, to make out with her foot the outlines and colours of a picture hidden under a carpet. 

Other experiments showed that her knees and shoulders had a similar sensitivity.

During all these tests Vera was blindfold; and, indeed, except when blindfold she lacked the ability to perceive things with her skin.

It was also found that although she could perceive things with her fingers this ability ceased the moment her hands were wet.
